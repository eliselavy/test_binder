    "This research combines current scientific knowledge and historical data to model the airborne dust concentration generated by the Belval steelworks in Esch-sur-Alzette between 1911 and 1997. The calculations are based on a model of atmospheric dispersion, using parameters such as production volumes, the presence of filter systems and meteorological data. Simulations, a form of data generation widely used in engineering, open new opportunities for the recreation of historical data. These historical data can be re-analysed and visualised on the basis of new and/or current perspectives. Visualisation of the simulated data offers insights into the extent and variability of dust concentrations over time, along with the underlying reasons (e.g. wars, technical innovations, …). An interdisciplinary approach allows for the integration of chemical and health perspectives, which are placed in a historical context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main aim is to explore new ways of generating, validating, analysing and visualising historical data through interdisciplinary collaboration, rather than to validate a model for the study of historical dust pollution. This work discusses (a) the model, (b) the parameters used, (c) the results of the dust simulation, (d) the impact on health, (e) the historical sources, and (f) the limitations of the model and the challenges involved in visualising and simulating historical data. The research is an interdisciplinary collaboration between the REMIX project (which focuses on the history of the Minett region, in the framework of the event Esch-sur-Alzette – European Capital of Culture 2022) and the LuxTIME project (which attempts to build and visualise historical datasets, with the aim of studying the impact of local environmental changes). \n"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Air pollution has a history. In today’s society, this historicity is most commonly perceived in the context of global warming, where the ‘weight’ of billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide released in the past has become a factor of major importance for our global ecosystem. The mechanism behind this has been elegantly described by Malm, who observed that our climate has essentially become a ‘product of past emissions’, while the ‘emissions produced [...][today will generate] their greatest impact on generations not yet born’. For Malm, present-day emissions are effectively ‘invisible missiles aimed at the future’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/BVE4ATFK\"></cite>). The adjective ‘invisible’ is rather important here. After all, the peculiar interrelationship between past, present and future is not the only paradoxical characteristic of air pollution history (on this interrelationship, see also (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/JIH9IWCS\"></cite>). Another paradox is the fact that the ongoing global warming is caused by a gas that, when encountered under everyday circumstances, is both invisible and odourless. This lack of perceptibility does not imply, however, that pollution problems went unnoticed by previous generations. Prior to the scientific and societal problematisation of the greenhouse effect, other manifestations of air pollution – such as dust, dark smoke, soot particles and stench – were particularly palpable in cities and industrial regions, and as such a regular source of indignation (for two classic studies on this indignation, see (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/7G926HZ5\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/5A48XCN3\"></cite>).\n",
    "\n",
    "The southwest of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, an important iron and steelmaking region from the 1870s onward, was one of those places where people were constantly faced with air pollution that was as omnipresent as the industrial plants themselves.  \n",
    "[For the economic and social history of Luxembourg’s metallurgical industry, see the seven-volume series *Terres Rouges: Histoire de la sidérurgie luxembourgeoise*, published from 2009 to 2022 by the National Archives of Luxembourg. It should be noted that this series does not discuss pollution problems.]  \n",
    "In the Minett, as Luxembourg’s metallurgical region is called, the soot and smoke of the steelworks were part of a ‘sensescape’ that could be seen and smelled on a near-permanent basis (on the notion of sensescape, see (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/AWY884EZ\"></cite>)). To borrow the words of an elderly inhabitant of Dudelange, who recently reminisced about his life in Luxembourg’s industrial region: day in, day out, ‘the dust and dirt fell from the skies’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/WUCR8ZG3\"></cite>). In order to objectify the severity of this problem, several scientific studies were carried out in the Minett towns of Differdange and Esch-sur-Alzette between the late 1930s and the early 1970s, with the specific aim of measuring the typical quantity of airborne dust particles on or near industrial sites. Yet these measurements – which we discuss in ([section 8.2](#anchor-Section-8-2)) – only lasted for a limited period (for instance three months), and thus only provide a snapshot in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this contribution, we attempt to create a *long-term* picture of past dust pollution levels by using the Belval iron and steel complex in Esch-sur-Alzette – the informal capital of the Minett (hereafter: Esch) – as a test case ([Figure 1](#anchor-figure-1)). For this purpose, historians, metallurgy experts, chemists and data visualisation specialists collaborated to analyse a major metallurgical pollutant: dust. We present a simulation and visualisation of the diachronic evolution of local airborne dust concentrations in the vicinity of the Belval plant, using various parameters as input for our model. These include the production numbers of the plant throughout the 20th century, the production process (e.g. LD-AC or Thomas for steelmaking), the typical usage of filtering systems, and the prevailing wind directions over time. Based on this data set, we offer a plausible approximation of how the dust emissions of the Belval iron and steel complex affected local air quality between 1911 (the first year of operation) and 1997 (when the last blast furnace was shut down).    \n",

    "An important precedent for modelling in environmental history can be found in the work of Tarr, who investigated emissions of man-made components such as pesticides, herbicides and heavy metals in the estuary of the Hudson and Raritan rivers between 1700 and 1980. To achieve this aim, Tarr collaborated with physicists and environmental engineers ((<cite data-cite=\"9139636/QGV6SBQW\"></cite>); see also (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/8T29IYMF\"></cite>)). Likewise, in their 2021 study on climate change and its effects on people, Pfister and Wanner attempted to reconcile the scientific cultures of the natural sciences and the humanities: ‘Scientists explain how natural systems work, while (environmental) historians tell stories of people who grapple with the effects of weather and climate’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/NPUEUWMA\"></cite>). As such, Pfister’s and Wanner’s research is in line with an approach outlined by Guldi and Armitage, who have discussed the role of history in the process of understanding ‘the multiple pasts which gave rise to our conflicted present’. Regarding climate change, Guldi and Armitage have argued that ‘history, with its rich, material understanding of human experience and institutions and its apprehension of multiple causality, is re-entering the arena of long-term discussions of time where evolutionary biologists, archaeologists, climate scientists, and economists have long been the only protagonists’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/S9N8XRLR\"></cite>). \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the way in which environmental history and the history of technology have become more entangled in the last decade (resulting in the development of a crossover field known as ‘envirotech’, e.g. (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/AWY884EZ\"></cite>)), interdisciplinary endeavours between the human and natural sciences are indeed essential if one wants to adequately evaluate environmental changes that have occurred in the past. This has been made explicit by Massard-Guilbaud:\n",
    "\n",
    "*How can we write a history of climate without contacting climatologists? A history of pollution without touching on chemistry? A history of sanitation systems or energy resources without taking an interest in technology? Let us note, moreover, that it is not only historians who are discovering this need for interdisciplinarity; specialists in other disciplines […] are also approaching historians [...] on environmental issues because [...] they feel the need to do so.* (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/65VPX7RN\"></cite>) \n",
    "[All translations throughout have been done by the authors.] \n",
    "\n",
    "The research questions that motivate our own interdisciplinary research are as follows. Throughout the 20th century, how were people living near the Belval iron and steel complex affected by dust pollution? Can this pollution from the past be quantified and displayed on a map? And how did it evolve over time? Using modelling and simulation with historical data as input, we generate new data that can answer such questions, thereby uniting the points of view of the exact sciences (e.g. the health impact of various concentration levels) and history (e.g. the industrial development of the region and the societal narratives about pollution). We hypothesise that the pollution generated by the Belval plant affected many (if not all) of the inhabited quarters of both Esch and the surrounding municipalities, including some on French territory, which would make Belval a case of cross-border air pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It must be emphasised that our contribution offers only an *estimation* of pollution values, due to the limitations inherent in any simulation. In the current study, such limitations include the lack of adequate corporate sources on the presence and efficiency of filtering systems, forcing a reliance on assumptions (based on data in non-Luxembourgish secondary literature on ideal typical metallurgical filtering systems). Another limitation of our model is the omission of other pollution sources, such as iron and steel complexes other than Belval, non-metallurgical industrial complexes, traffic and domestic heating. As such, we agree with a warning recently posited by Parr concerning interdisciplinary work. While she endorsed collaborations between ‘researchers in environmental history and the history of technology’ and scientists from fields like ‘metallurgy [and] bio-chemistry […]’, Parr pointed at possible incompatibilities between historical science and the natural sciences, due to the latter’s tendency to ‘simplify’ for the purpose of experimentation, as well as to ‘derogate knowledge and reasoning that is not readily represented in symbols and signs’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/EBJDZCKR\"></cite>). In our interdisciplinary contribution, we take a rather modest view on this matter, by explicitly pointing at the potential of our research as well as the lacunae and possibilities for future improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The broader historiographical relevance of our undertaking is manifold. Investigating historical pollution levels can provide insights into the long-term environmental impact of industrial activities, as it helps to assess the lasting effects of pollution on ecosystems and human populations over time. Studying past pollution can also shed light on the disparities in the distribution of environmental hazards and their impact on communities: a phenomenon nowadays known as environmental (in)justice (on its relevance in historiography, see (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/DGAMEL67\"></cite>). Finally, by sharing our findings with a non-specialised audience (as we have done in the context of a 2022 online exhibition), our research also contributes to educating the local community about the historical context of pollution. In an ideal scenario, such education has the potential to cultivate a heightened sense of responsibility for environmental stewardship. \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of our article is as follows. In ([section 2](#anchor-Section-2)) we discuss the terms ‘modelling’ and ‘simulation’, their history and application across disciplines, and their largely untapped potential in the humanities. ([Section 3](#anchor-Section-3)) explains the general impact of dust pollution on health, in order to provide a basis for the subsequent analysis of our results. ([Section 4](#anchor-Section-4)) establishes the historical context of the metallurgical industry in Luxembourg, the Minett region and Esch, while also briefly exploring some societal narratives about pollution. In ([section 5](#anchor-Section-5)) we introduce steelmaking production techniques as well as their evolution and impact on dust pollution. ([Section 6](#anchor-Section-6)) explains the actual simulation process by focusing on the data generated by the dispersion model. Here, we discuss the data basis and the model specifications, in relation to our hypothesis about the impact of pollution on the inhabitants of Esch and the surrounding area. In ([section 7](#anchor-Section-7)) we outline the data visualisation process, while ([section 8](#anchor-Section-8)) contains an analysis of the results, including the validation of the model used (a basic Gaussian dispersion model that has already been proven through its use in similar scenarios). Additionally, a comparison of the model results against available measurements is presented in ([subsection 8.2](#anchor-Section-8-2)), while the limitations and potential ways to improve the model in future research are covered in ([section 8.3](#anchor-Section-8-3)) and ([8.4](#anchor-Section-8-4)). For future research on historical dust pollution, the model could be used with alternative data sources for new simulations, or new models could be tested adding new variables. Our conclusions are offered in the final ([section 9](#anchor-Section-9)).\n"

    "## Modelling and simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since modelling and simulation are key elements in our research, a brief introduction of terms and usage across disciplines is appropriate. Banks defined simulation as ‘the imitation of the operation of a real-worId process or system over time’ that can model both existing and conceptual systems (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/ED4NSVNR\"></cite>). As such, simulation is used for a variety of purposes including prediction, performance, training, entertainment, proof and discovery. While *induction* can be used to find patterns in data and *deduction* to find consequences of assumptions, *simulation* generates data that can be analysed inductively (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/9Y6J422P\"></cite>).\n",
    "\n",
    "Initiated during the Second World War ‘to address problems too complex for theory and too remote from laboratory materials for experiment’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/DTHRNK72\"></cite>), simulation spread through the social sciences by the end of the 1960s, where it was (and still is) often used for modelling artificial populations and investigating human behaviour (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/MMPSSPQU\"></cite>). More specifically in the field of pollution studies, spatial analysis has been proven useful: Cichowicz and Dobrzanski, for instance, studied the concentration of air pollution using computer modelling of pollutant dispersion based on real measurements in the city of Łódź, Poland (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/SGVS57F7\"></cite>). Wang and Chen predicted the spatial concentration distributions of airborne pollutants, using a GIS-based multi-source and multi-box modelling approach (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/V94FMWWS\"></cite>). Banerjee et al. performed an assessment of ambient NO2 concentration in Pantnagar, India through a simulation of two mathematical dispersive models (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/KGT3G2CD\"></cite>).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, notwithstanding a few exceptions, simulation has remained ‘almost unknown to the humanities’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/67W7QRXS\"></cite>). Apart from the environmental historical research mentioned in the ([introduction](#anchor-introduction)), Lebherz et al. have presented a case of text mining by scientific workflows and computer simulation, with the aim of investigating potential influences on the author’s literary productivity. In this context, they have identified four prerequisites: a solid data basis, the specification and construction of a model, the definition of hypotheses to answer research questions, and the reuse of proven models in similar scenarios (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/MMPSSPQU\"></cite>). Simulation is also frequently used in certain fields of archaeological research, such as evolutionary archaeology and the study of human evolution (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/7MGXND7N\"></cite>). Champion has discussed the distinction between model (‘a physical or digital representation of a product or process’) and simulation (‘the re-configurative use of a model to reveal new and potential aspects’) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/7RBGTWXL\"></cite>). In the context of the humanities, McCarty has referred to modelling as ‘the analogical bridge between computing and the interpretative disciplines’ that ‘keeps the digital construct separate, informing humanistic research both by what it discovers and especially by what it cannot’. The defining moment of simulation occurs ‘when it becomes the only way to know something or to form a coherent picture from fragmentary knowledge’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/67W7QRXS\"></cite>).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our research, the model and simulation are inspired by the exact sciences described above. Our innovativeness stems from the use of historical data to populate the parameters, as well as from the integration of our results in a public history framework.\n"

    "## Dust pollution from a chemical and health perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the airborne dust concentration from the Belval plant entails delving into both the chemical and health dimensions of dust pollution. Understanding the various particle types, their sizes and associated implications is essential for establishing the pertinence of this information to the primary research objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pollution caused by dust (atmospheric particulate matter) is a global problem, both historically and in the present (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/BLRP3PKV\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/AA24KHGH\"></cite>).  Dust from various anthropogenic sources such as industry, households and traffic is a major source of chemical contamination and has a negative health impact. Dust particles can also originate from natural sources, like pollen, microorganisms and the natural erosion of soils. The size, origin and chemical composition of particles play a major role when looking at health and environmental effects. The particles under consideration in this study and their implications for health and environment are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airborne dust comes in all shapes and sizes, which are either visible or invisible to the naked eye (aerodynamic diameter 1 to 400 µm) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/CBTS62BJ\"></cite>). Large particles settle quickly (> 100 µm) or are trapped in the nose, mouth and larynx region when inhaled (*inhalable* fraction ≤ 100 µm), as shown in ([Figure 2](#anchor-figure-2)) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/39NTD5PU\"></cite>). Smaller particles stay for longer in the air, while very small particles can penetrate the respiratory system. The *respirable* dust fraction that can enter the alveolar region is defined to be below an aerodynamic diameter of 10 µm, independent of the particle’s length (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/GSZZ3J9G\"></cite>). Small particles that remain in the gas-exchange region of the lungs can cause allergic reactions, cancer and other serious diseases or disorders (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/39NTD5PU\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/GSZZ3J9G\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/VZ8SV6QR\"></cite>).  \n"

    "Dust sources can be either point or area sources, from where particles with long lifetimes can spread over many kilometres (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VFY3UZHT\"></cite>). Their chemical composition is essentially linked to their origin: during the extraction and processing of minerals, for instance, dust containing silica is often released in the air, which can result in permanent health damage (e.g. diseases such as silicosis) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/WDVE4CAB\"></cite>). Likewise, metallic dusts (e.g. lead and cadmium) from smelters cause harm to fauna and flora, as do chemical dusts created in agriculture (e.g. pesticides), vegetable dusts (e.g. wood, cotton), moulds and spores (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/GSZZ3J9G\"></cite>). Other air pollutants are created by the reaction of sunlight with atmospheric compounds, leading to photochemical smog (sunlight reacting with volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides).\n",
    "\n",
    "The iron and steel industry is a major contributor to air pollution. In the past, burning coal for steel production produced vast amounts of black coal dust, resulting in fine particles covering cities and regions. Such particles often contain silica and various metals; those with a diameter below 2.5 µm can easily enter the alveoli (the gas-exchange regions of the lungs) ([Figure 2](#anchor-Figure-2)) and cause serious harm (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/6GSZNWJJ\"></cite>). Early types of filtering devices based on cyclone techniques only removed larger particles, thus leaving smaller fractions uncaptured (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/XZIJWE3R\"></cite>). \n",
    "    \n",
    "With the rise of environmental regulation and technical advances from the mid-20th century onward, it became possible to significantly decrease dust emissions as long as steel companies were prepared to make the necessary investments. The decrease was mainly enabled by improved filtering techniques, including shaker bag collectors, reverse air or pulse jet baghouses, and cartridge collectors (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/XZIJWE3R\"></cite>). However, even today many iron and steel plants continue to rely on coal fuel (the ‘dirtiest’ but also cheapest option available), with little concern for the environmental effects and the availability of cleaner techniques (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/9FSXYV6G\"></cite>). Besides greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide (N$_{2}$O), steelmaking generates airborne contaminants (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/PKEAEGMY\"></cite>). Metals like cobalt, lead and chromium are released into the atmosphere (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/65CPAIU7\"></cite>) when not filtered appropriately, and so are concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), iron oxides and sulphur dioxide (SO$_{2}$) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VZ8SV6QR\"></cite>). Historically as well as in the present, respirable particle emissions from the iron and steel industry pose risks to human health (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/9WWKAKLJ\"></cite>). \n"

    "Measured per capita, Luxembourg was the world’s foremost iron and steel producer throughout the 20th century (for global production trends, see (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/CX6W8XTN\"></cite>)). While all the Minett’s towns were severely affected by air pollution, Esch had the specific characteristic of being surrounded by iron and steel complexes. The local historians Assa and Pagliarini have rightfully noted that ‘Esch and its factories formed one unity; their evolution occurred along parallel lines’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/LJMD8TYE\"></cite>). From the moment the first blast furnace in Esch started operating, the urban infrastructure of this ‘mushroom town’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/94QCD9U4\"></cite>) indeed developed almost exclusively to serve the metallurgical industry. An engraving from the 1920s shows that iron and steel complexes could be found to the southwest of Esch (the *Terres Rouges* plant, established in 1872), to the east (the Esch-Schifflange plant, 1871) and to the west (the Belval plant, 1911). Other polluting factories, such as a cement factory, a brewery and a coal-fired power plant (which supplied electricity to the steelworks) were also present in the town throughout much of industrial era (for a general overview, see (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/8B4FCCAA\"></cite>) ). A scale model of the Minett, made for the 1937 World’s Fair in Paris, clearly illustrates how Esch was ‘embraced’ by factories and, consequently, by industrial smoke and dust (on Luxembourg’s participation at the 1937 World’s Fair, see (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/4LAQC9HW\"></cite>))."

    "Contrary to present-day popular belief (e.g. (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/367VRBR5\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/Y3SSZ4J6\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/WUCR8ZG3\"></cite>)), the air pollution caused by the metallurgical complexes of the Minett was not uncontested by the local population. From the early 20th century onwards, inhabitants voiced their criticism about dusty factory smoke through articles in newspapers and magazines, readers’ letters and interventions in parliament and municipal council meetings. This paragraph will shortly explore a few criticisms concerning the Belval complex from the period when the plant was established. A more in-depth analysis of complaints from inhabitants about air pollution in the entire Minett region is offered in a separate article, which focuses on the period of the *Trente Glorieuses* (c. 1945-1965) and conceptualises the role of newspapers, politicians and scientists as ‘mediators’ in the public debate on air pollution (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/M4JBZLNQ\"></cite>).\n",
    "\n",
    "From around 1900, about three decades after the dawn of industrialisation in Luxembourg, the country’s press began to report on the so-called ‘plagues’ of dust and smoke (in German: *Staubplage*, *Rauchplage*). These ‘plagues’ were reported to soil clothes and buildings, irritate lungs and eyes, and affect animal and plant life. As early as 1899, for example, the newspaper *Luxemburger Wort* published a remarkably lucid analysis of air pollution in industrial regions (for the history of this newspaper, see (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/SCK8QXWH\"></cite>)). Despite its conservative, pro-business profile, the newspaper offered a remarkably modern-sounding, holistic approach towards both human and non-human nature, thus offering a rather bleak picture of the industrial era:\n",
    "\n",
    "*No more than fifteen years ago, everyone took for granted that a chimney should smoke, and every stranger who came to a factory town looked in admiration at the myriad of smoking chimneys […]. Even those who were directly harmed by the smoke considered this to be so inevitable that they hardly ever complained about it, and when they did, they were told – with a shrug – that nothing could be changed. And so for decades, the vegetation in industrial areas withered, entire forests had to be cut down prematurely […], and soot particles and poisonous gases inhaled by human lungs slowly but surely planted the germ of many a deadly disease.*  (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/SUDCL4YQ\"></cite>)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Already around this time, awareness about the detrimental side effects of metallurgical dust also existed on a governmental level. This becomes evident in a 1910 investigation undertaken at the instigation of the Luxembourg Prime Minister in response to the construction request for the Belval plant submitted by the German corporation Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks AG. At that time, the corporation had recently acquired a plot of forested land just to the west of Esch. Conceived as a vertically integrated plant, the Belval complex was to include two blast furnaces (later supplemented with a third), steel converters, a sintering plant and rolling mills. In a letter to three engineers (who were most likely state-employed), the Prime Minister expressed reservations about the addition of yet another metallurgical factory in the Minett: ‘[…] [It] is necessary to investigate all [technical] methods to curtail noise […] and dust […].’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/88ILKR6H\"></cite>)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent with the legal framework of the time (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/BIXVKRZR\"></cite>), the Prime Minister’s reservations were mainly driven by a desire to minimise damage to the private property of adjacent landowners; a true ‘environmental’ awareness (as can be seen embryonically in the very *avant-garde* 1899 newspaper article mentioned above) was not yet part of the politicians’ intellectual *habitus*. In response, the experts offered a highly ambiguous evaluation of the prospective plant. Although they acknowledged the existence of a pollution burden, this burden was considered to be a ‘normal’ phenomenon in industrial regions:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The inconveniences these kinds of establishment can have for certain [neighbouring] owners in terms of their enjoyment of the tranquillity and pure air of the countryside are not to be denied. These inconveniences stem from the vapours and dust that detract from the purity of the air, as well as the noise caused by the machines and the movement of workers […]. Such inconveniences are common in industrial centres; everyone experiences them in Esch, Differdange, Rodange, Dudelange, etc. Yet they cannot be invoked as a reason to refuse authorisation.*  (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/83GK3TZT\"></cite>)\n",
    "\n",
    "This discourse was typical of the professional ethos of late-19th and early-20th-century engineers, who typically saw themselves as expert organisers, both within and beyond their technical sphere of competence (on the role of engineers in Luxembourg society, see (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/FAY5AGIE\"></cite>)). As such, the engineers also gave advice about the moral economy in which the steelmaking was to take place: in their view, the imperative of economic development outweighed the time-honoured right of neighbouring inhabitants to ‘pure’ air. The engineers’ opinion proved to be decisive: shortly after the governmental enquiry, a green light was given to the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks AG, and in 1911 the two blast furnaces of the iron and steel complex (which would later become known as Belval) were fired up. Soon enough, newspapers would again voice concerns about the increasing dust problem in Esch. In April 1914, just three months before the start of the First World War, another conservative newspaper, the *Obermosel-Zeitung*, for instance voiced concerns about the worsening ‘smoke plague’: \n",
    "\n",
    "*If any town far and wide suffers greatly from the smoke plague, it is Esch. No fewer than 30 to 40 blast furnace chimneys in the town’s immediate vicinity spew their contents on the Minett’s capital day and night. If a resourceful person were to come up with an effective invention against the smoke plague, he should certainly file a patent in Esch. It is only a small consolation for the people of Esch to hear that the smoke plague is also known to be a great evil in other places, and that in many cases desperate efforts are being made to combat it […].* (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/KWZQVEKV\"></cite>)\n",
    "\n",
    "Still in 1914, the Esch-based architect Paul Flesch declared in a municipal council meeting that Esch should keep a corridor without industry in the north, to allow the town’s 30 000 inhabitants ‘to breathe some clean air for at least a few days a year’. With his call for the incorporation of public hygiene principles in urban planning policies, Flesch sought to pair economic development with a more decent quality of life for the town’s inhabitants (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/V53RXXSN\"></cite>). As it turned out, the north of Esch would effectively remain industry-free – even though the ‘right to produce’ (and, consequently, the right to pollute) of the existing iron and steel complexes would never be called into question by local and national authorities. Using a term from German historiography (e.g. (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/9W8LFXTR\"></cite>)), it can be said that these authorities consistently affirmed the *Ortsüblichkeit* (‘geographical appropriateness’) of industry. This principle was further underpinned by the powerful political and economic position of the ARBED company (*Aciéries réunies de Burbach-Eich-Dudelange*), which took over ownership of the Belval complex in 1919 (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/94QCD9U4\"></cite>). In this constellation, the plant would thrive: between 1911 and 1997, a total of almost 80 million tonnes of iron was produced at the Belval site – or about one third of Luxembourg’s total production during that period. Belval’s corresponding steel production amounted to approximately 75 million tonnes – a number that is continuing to grow to this day, as the steelworks are still in operation even after the closure of the last blast furnace in 1997 (for production numbers, see (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/94QCD9U4\"></cite>)). As we will investigate in the following sections, these very high production levels also had a severe impact on the local environment.\n"

    "## Steelmaking techniques in Luxembourg\n",
    "\n",
    "As steelmaking techniques developed, the degree of dust pollution resulting from the steel industry in the Minett varied over time. Initially, at the onset of industrialisation in the 1870s, Luxembourg’s plants used the Bessemer process, the first industrial method to produce steel from molten pig iron, which was invented in the 1850s and complemented in 1864 by the Siemens-Martin process (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/HZ5XK6GN\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/SQ4TQY24\"></cite>). Impurities were removed by oxidation, i.e. by blowing air through the molten iron. However, as the iron ore found in the Minett is high in phosphorous, only low-quality steel could be manufactured (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/HZ5XK6GN\"></cite>). This changed with the modification of the Bessemer process by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas, who used dolomite, which is basic, as the converter lining (instead of packed sand, which is acidic), thereby removing the phosphorous from the steel into the slag (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/HZ5XK6GN\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/SQ4TQY24\"></cite>). In Luxembourg, the first Thomas steel was produced in 1886; the process was complemented by electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking after 1900. From the 1950s onwards, pure oxygen processes like the LD-AC process (*Linz-Donawitz – ARBED – Centre national de recherches métallurgiques de Liège*) were predominantly used to produce higher quality steel with fewer impurities compared to Thomas steel (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/HZ5XK6GN\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/SQ4TQY24\"></cite>).  [Other techniques replacing Thomas steel were the Lance Bubbling Equilibrium (LBE), ARBED Ladle Treatment (ALT) or LD Kaldo, and Rotovert. (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/HZ5XK6GN\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/SQ4TQY24\"></cite>)]\n",
    "\n",
    "The LD-AC method was reported to generate less dust (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/EG7EKVXT\"></cite>). In a 1972 article, Metz signalled that the steelworks in the Minett used two principal techniques to perform dedusting: electro-static purification with negatively charged dust particles collected on a positive collection plate, and wet processes which retained dust with water (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/SQ4TQY24\"></cite>). The efficiency of these processes seems to have been limited, however. According to Hoffmann (1974), who based her findings on an undisclosed source, dust pollution levels in Esch regularly exceeded 1.8 g/m$^{3}$/day, which was well beyond the West German environmental limits of the time (0.42 g/m$^{2}$/day for urban zones and 0.85 g/m$^{2}$/day for industrial zones) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/FZS9EXTQ\"></cite>). But even though she was a critic of the steel industry, Hoffmann claimed that 90% of the air pollution in Luxembourg resulted from households (oil heating) and traffic, and not from the iron and steel works – a position in line with that of the steel industry (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/SQ4TQY24\"></cite>). A number of measurements undertaken between the mid-1950s and the early 1970s, which we discuss below (([section 8.2](#anchor-Section-8-2)),), indicate that this estimation was most likely too flattering for the metallurgical industry, and that the airborne iron oxide load caused by steel processes was probably much higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time Metz and Hoffmann published their articles, governmental awareness about the environmental impact of the iron and steel industry was on the rise. This rise was spurred by multiple factors, including decades of public complaints, the international emergence of the ‘modern’ environmental movement in the second half of the 1960s, and the ongoing scientific research on metallurgical pollution conducted in the transnational framework of the European Coal and Steel Community (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/M4JBZLNQ\"></cite>). As a result, in the mid-1970s, the demand for the ‘polluter pays’ principle became stronger, eventually requiring Luxembourg’s industry to minimise its environmental impact ((<cite data-cite=\"9139636/FZS9EXTQ\"></cite>); on the worldwide rise of environmental policy-making during the 1970s, see for instance (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/X5YPQYZP\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/JQJ3M73L\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/JIH9IWCS\"></cite>)). The iron oxide content in the Minett’s atmosphere was addressed in a 1976 parliamentary debate, when an MP stated that the ‘red clouds’ of iron oxide were predominantly a result of Thomas steel production, while the LD-AC process (which was usually operated with pre-installed filters) was reported to generate less dust (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/EG7EKVXT\"></cite>). In Luxembourg, the last Thomas steel was produced in 1977 (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/SQ4TQY24\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/FZS9EXTQ\"></cite>).\n"

    "## The simulation process\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation of our dust simulation model – estimating dust concentrations from 1911 to 1997 – was performed at our request by Inspyro, a technical consultancy company assisting metallurgical enterprises. The various sources (and their limitations) used as input data for the Gaussian model are explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to create the atmospheric dispersion models needed to understand and predict air pollution. Gaussian, Lagrangian, Eulerian and computational fluid dynamics models all offer possibilities, differing in their mathematical complexity and field of application. \n",
    "[Gaussian models assume a normal statistical distribution (parabolic behaviour near the origin of the coordinates, “bell curve”) and are typically used for buoyant air pollution plumes. This approach historically dominated dispersion models with a number of simplifications to be taken in the advection-diffusion equations. Lagrangian models use trajectories – calculated using ordinary differential equations – of air pollutants determined by e.g. wind field, buoyancy and turbulence (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VFY3UZHT\"></cite>). Pollutant particles are followed in time and space along their trajectories. Eulerian models use a fixed coordinate frame providing a spatiotemporal evolution of pollutant concentration at each time step and point in the grid. For environmental and health protection measures, computational fluid dynamics models are often used in complex geometry where a fine grid resolution is required to calculate turbulence effects (Lagrangian and Eulerian: coarse grid). This model does account for flow velocities and turbulence in a complex 3D terrain, unlike the Gaussian approach (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VFY3UZHT\"></cite>). For more information and a detailed comparison see Leelőssy (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VFY3UZHT\"></cite>).] \n",
    "All models require the input of parameters like meteorological data, emission parameters and terrain information. To develop such a model, an interdisciplinary approach including disciplines like meteorology, chemistry and physics is often the best option. The output data is usually plotted on maps indicating areas of higher/lower air pollution concentrations and therefore higher/lower health risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, a basic Gaussian dispersion model, as shown by Leelőssy et al. – known for its fast response time in the application of long-term average loads for distances between 1 and 100 km – was used (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VFY3UZHT\"></cite>).

Stockie defines dispersion as the ‘combination of turbulent diffusion and advection by the wind’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VJJH2QQ8\"></cite>). Atmospheric contaminant concentrations can therefore be explained using the advection-diffusion equation. Using the simplified model of a Gaussian plume, it is assumed that air contaminants come unidirectionally (given the wind direction) from one point source – here one chimney of the Belval steel plant –, as outlined in ([Figure 5](#anchor-figure-5)).\n"

    "For the Belval case, only one chimney of the steel plant was assumed to be the point source. To calculate the amount of dust produced per month, the various steelmaking processes were categorised; sintering and crushing of iron ore were the main processes contributing to dust production during ironmaking. The average amounts of dust produced by the three steelmaking processes were subsequently used to calculate the amount of dust generated during the production of raw iron. For electric steel production (using an electric arc furnace, EAF), the average amount of dust was multiplied by the amount of steel produced (see ([Figure 6](#anchor-figure-6))). The same approach was applied to Thomas steel and LD-AC steel. Annual steel production data at the Belval plant was retrieved from a table reproduced in a study by Knebeler and Scuto (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/94QCD9U4\"></cite>). This table includes the production data of steel in tonnes per steelmaking technique (Thomas, LD-AC, EAF, total steel) per year, shown in ([Figure 6](#anchor-figure-6)). As the simulation output shows, the dust concentrations are calculated as averages per month. (The annual production values turn out to be a limitation, since monthly data would generate a more exact output of the model.) The hypothetical average dust values generated per process (blast furnace, sintering furnace, EAF and LD-AC) were taken from Schueneman, as summarised in ([Table 1](#anchor-table-1)) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/QGZMVKKP\"></cite>). Schueneman offered typical values for steel plants in the US in 1963; as such, our hypothetical average dust values offer only an estimation of dust-producing steel processes in Luxembourg from 1911 to 1997.

    "The hypothetical installation date of filters (with varying efficiencies) was likewise taken from Schueneman (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/QGZMVKKP\"></cite>) ([Table 1](#anchor-table-1)). Based on this hypothesis, steel production techniques in Belval after 1963 were assumed to have state-of-the-art filters installed. Again, the installation dates are typical estimates for US steel plants until 1963, which will not correspond 1:1 with our case study on Luxembourg. We used these assumptions because of the lack of literature on the historical presence and efficiency of filter systems in the European iron and steel industry. [Table 1](#anchor-table-1) summarises the filters installed per technique (based on Schueneman); the amount of dust caught by a filter was subtracted from the total amount produced. Afterwards the calculated amount of dust in t/year was converted into g/sec. "

Produced by the Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (University of Luxembourg) in connection with *Esch-sur-Alzette – European Capital of Culture 2022*, the exhibition offers twenty-two stories, outlining various transformations of landscapes, places and people, from the region’s industrialisation in the late 19th century to the crisis of the 1970s and the subsequent deindustrialisation. Instead of focusing on the often-told stories about the growth and success of the steel industry, *Minett Stories* explores everyday life in the Minett, with attention to questions such as environmental pollution.\n",

July has been chosen, as this is the month when the pollution typically reached the farthest in the town of Esch.\n"

Using a 1958 map of Esch as a reference, the affected areas primarily included the neighbourhoods of Uecht, Clair-Chêne, Al-Esch and Wobrecken. Moreover, from the outset, Belval’s dust pollution was a cross-border phenomenon, with the French villages of Rédange, Russange and Audun-le-Tiche (the latter itself the site of an ironworks from the 1880s to the 1960s) sharing the pollution burden with small Luxembourgish locations such as Soleuvre, Ehlerange and Belvaux."

In Luxembourg, the first legislation regarding air pollution was the ‘Loi du 21 juin 1976 relative à la lutte contre la pollution de l’atmosphère’. No limit values were laid down in this legislation. In the more recent context of EU law, Directive 2008/50/EC (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/RP4N59KT\"></cite>) postulates limit values for different atmospheric pollutants to protect human health, including values for PM$_{2.5}$ (25 µg/ m$^{3}$) and metals like Cd (5 ng/ m$^{3}$) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/UPIACA6C\">). \n",
    "\n",
    "Such fine-grained values not only indicate recent improvements in measuring methods, but are also indicative of an increase in awareness among legislators in recent decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model, however, does not distinguish between the various dust fractions or different pollutants. When comparing the simulation model with the current EU legislation values, the calculated maximum (3 mg/ m$^{3}$) clearly exceeds the limit related to particulate matter concentration (25 µm/ m$^{3}$ for PM$_{2.5}$). Furthermore, the EU directive from 2008 is under revision following the recent proposal of more stringent values by the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2021, the WHO indeed put forward a maximum value of 5 µg/ m$^{3}$ for long-term PM$_{2.5}$ exposure in order to protect human health (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/NYTCQHFM\"></cite>).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific legislative values have also been established for industrial producers. Relevant EU laws include the 2001 ‘Directive on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (2001/80/EC)’, followed by the 2010 ‘Directive on industry emissions (2010/75/EU)’, which focuses particularly on industrial pollution. Summarising the various sector-specific directives, a dust limit concentration of 30 mg/N m$^{3}$ for coal and other solid fuels is valid in all EU member states. The N in the concentration unit emphasises an important point to consider. Since dust values depend on pressure and temperature, a comparison with other values requires standardised conditions (N: 25°C, 1 atm). This is another limitation of our model, as temperature and pressure data were not included. Compared to the simulated dust concentrations, the limit value is much higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Decision (EU) 2017/1757 of the Council of the European Union defines separate dust limit values for the iron and steel industry: 50 mg/ m$^{3}$ for sintering, 15-20 mg/ m$^{3}$ for pelletising plants, 10 mg/ m$^{3}$ for hot blast stoves in blast furnaces (> 2.5t/h), 30 mg/ m$^{3}$ for oxygen steelmaking and casting (> 2.5 t/h), and 5 (new ovens) to 15 (existing ovens) mg/ m$^{3}$ for steel production and casting using the EAF process (> 2.5 t/h) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/Q2WEHT6K\"></cite>). In comparison, our calculated dust amount is below these limits. These values, however, define steelmaking processes of today, not of the past; moreover, they are process specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Regarding workplace exposure limits measured in time-weighted averages, pollutant-specific levels can be found in legislation. In Luxembourg, they are regulated by the ‘Réglement Grand-Ducal du 14 novembre 2016 concernant la protection de la sécurité et de la santé des salariés contre les risques liés à des agents chimiques sur le lieu de travail’ (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VHX5Q8XZ\"></cite>).\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "In general, it can be said that it is difficult to compare the simulated dust values with legislative limit values. First, our values do not include information about external conditions like temperature and pressure, which is necessary to perform an exact comparison. Second, and even more important, the calculated dust concentrations reveal neither the composition of dust and the type of pollutants, nor the dust generating process in steelmaking. Therefore, limit values for specific dust fractions or processes cannot be applied. Moreover, when looking at dust concentrations in legislation, it clearly makes a difference whether one looks for general or sector-specific directives, as illustrated above. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Nevertheless, there is evidence for the health impact of air pollution coming from the iron and steel industry in Luxembourg and other countries. Of course, other factors such as climate, noise, vibrations and other types of pollution (e.g. soil, water) had an influence, too. Regarding health effects in Luxembourg, Molitor and Mosinger published a study (1960) on the effects of atmospheric dust on human health (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/BVYHQ8P6\"></cite>). They found evidence for a causation between industry dust and pulmonary diseases like silicosis and siderosis. In 1975, a medical symposium on industrial medicine took place in Luxembourg, which collected several studies on the effects of industry emissions on respiratory diseases and proved the impact of dust emission on health (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/PJ9ZTDSQ\"></cite>). A special focus of researchers was on the occupational health of steel workers, which were exposed to even higher amounts of pollution than the citizens around steel plants (field of occupational medicine (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/A3DNKHRH\"></cite>)). Other studies demonstrating the health impact of atmospheric steel pollution have been conducted in England (concerning mortality effects, (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/FZF9GRND\"></cite>)), China (concerning heavy metals that represent a carcinogenic risk above certain limits, (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/IXIDVNXT\"></cite>)), and in Albania and Brasil (concerning chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VZ8SV6QR\"></cite>) and (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/9WWKAKLJ\"></cite>)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In combination with time witness reports (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/EG7EKVXT\"></cite>) and dust measurements conducted in other countries (see above) this information on dust-related health effects supports the assumption that the dust pollution in the area around the Belval plant exceeded most of the current legislative limits presented above.\n"

    "### Comparison of the model results with air pollution measurements from the late 1930s to the early 1970s  \n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the simulated dust levels with real conditions, it is important to scrutinise historical documents on dust measurements in the Minett region. We were able to retrieve data about four measurements performed between the late 1930s and the early 1970s: 1939 (Schifflange, undertaken by the ARBED steel company) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/WGAL532E\"></cite>), 1956-1957 (Differdange, undertaken by the government) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VUP7Y9SW\"></cite>), 1966-1969 (Esch, undertaken by the municipality) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/XP9DGUVF\"></cite>), and 1970-1971 (Belval, undertaken in an academic context) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/7BPU6L8S\"></cite>). In all cases, dust was collected for a specified period through passive samplers (known as Bergerhoff devices). Both the motivation for the measurements and the methodological framework for the subsequent interpretation differed over time, as we will outline below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1939, ARBED undertook dust measurements on the premises of its Schifflange iron and steel complex, located directly to the east of Esch (about 2.5 km from the Belval plant, which was owned by the same company) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/WGAL532E\"></cite>). Investigated parameters included the amount of dust generated by the blast furnaces, particle sizes and the iron (Fe) content of the samples. This analysis was conducted for economic reasons only, with the aim of studying the potential for reusing blast furnace gas after the removal of dust particles. The analysis pointed out that very small dust particles (ranging from 0 to 10 µm) constituted about 25% of the total emitted dust mass; as noted in ([section 3](#anchor-Section-3)),, such particles can penetrate the respiratory system and pose a threat to human health. In addition, around 48% of all dust released was reported to be made up of Fe: a very high iron content that was not unusual in the context of the Thomas steelmaking process. Even though the 1939 corporate investigation concluded that recycling and filtering techniques would be too expensive to implement, it is clear – in retrospect – that the installation of a dedicated filter could have resulted in significant health gains for both the local population and factory employees. \n",
    "\n",
    "About two decades later, the scientists Molitor and Barthel conducted a government investigation of the dust concentration in the vicinity of the Differdange iron and steel complex (1956, published in 1958) (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VUP7Y9SW\"></cite>). Six passive samplers were placed for a period of about three months in a 2 km radius around the plant, allowing the amount of dust in g per m² per month to be calculated and a compositional analysis to be performed. Molitor and Barthel claimed that insoluble particles such as Fe2O3, SiO2, CaO and SO4 did not have harmful effects, regardless of particles sizes. However, pulmonary diseases like siderosis (caused by iron dust) were identified decades before this study was published (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/E44LPYH7\"></cite>), indicating that this claim was incorrect even at the time of publication. Dust fractions below 0.03 mm (*inhalable* fraction, see ([section 3](#anchor-Section-3)),) were observed in the samples, including silica, which indeed poses a risk for respiratory diseases and other health issues. The Differdange analysis further indicated that dust concentrations dropped rapidly as the distance from the factory increased, starting with 140 g/m²/month near the centre of pollution and falling to about 40 g/m²/month at a 2 km distance. With the decreasing dust mass, the iron content decreased as well, dropping from 75% to 38.4% (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VUP7Y9SW\"></cite>). These measurements once again show the high contribution of steelmaking to dust pollution levels in the Minett, especially near blast furnaces. However, the values measured by Molitor and Barthel cannot be compared directly to the simulation presented in our analysis, since the passive sampler was unable to capture fractions of dust below 5 µm (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/JB9SKWD7\"></cite>); in addition, the measurement units and production site are not the same. The measured values in 1956 nevertheless seem to be far higher than the simulated ones, which indicates that the dust concentrations in our simulation are probably underestimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1966-1969, Barthel was again involved in dust measurements, this time commissioned by the municipal administration of Esch (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/XP9DGUVF\"></cite>). Barthel’s new observations were publicly released in 1972, a year marked by intense worldwide interest in environmental pollution problems – not least with the publication of the Club of Rome’s report *Limits to Growth* (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/JQJ3M73L\"></cite>). Compared to the Differdange analysis, the number of measurement points was increased to 52 (spread over the entire surface area of the town), resulting in 16 samplers per km$^{2}$. This allowed for a more fine-grained analysis of the accumulated dust generated by multiple iron and steel complexes (Belval, *Terres Rouges* and Schifflange). The measurements were subsequently compared to the West German limit values for atmospheric dust pollution, which were a maximum of 0.42 g/m$^{2}$/day in urban zones and 0.85 g/m$^{2}$/day in industrial zones (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/XP9DGUVF\"></cite>). Over half of the measurement points were reported to exceed the West German dust limits for *urban* regions (34 in 1966-1967, 35 in 1967-1968 and 28 in 1968-1969), while several points even showed values above the *industrial* limits (9, 6 and 7 respectively). When compared to the simulation model, the measured values are significantly higher (dimensions of measurements in g/day and for the simulation in mg/month). The dust composition showed an iron oxide content of about 65%, varying with distance, indicating a clear link with the steelworks. Even though Barthel incorrectly stressed that the dust concentrations had no significant effect on human health, he did call for technical improvements that could bring the pollution levels down to the West German norm for industrial zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in 1971, Christiane Conter wrote a dissertation on atmospheric pollution, based on measurements performed in 1970-1971 as part of an academic research project at the Belval plant (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/7BPU6L8S\"></cite>). Conter’s work clearly presented an environmental point of view, with a focus on various sources of pollution (steelworks, households and traffic). The dust samples at the Belval steel complex were specifically analysed regarding fluorine compounds, known for being released during various industrial processes and for their toxic effects on vegetation and animals. Sampling stations were placed near various points in the production chain; the average dust concentration measured was 6 g/m$^{2}$/day, which exceeded not only the West German legislative limits but also the measurements undertaken by Barthel in the years before. Just like Molitor and Barthel (Differdange, 1956-1957), Conter analysed dust composition in terms of soluble and insoluble particles. However, her specific focus on fluorinated compounds yielded no concrete results, as possible trace amounts were superimposed by the dust matrix. Additionally, the methods used (X-ray spectroscopy and electron microscopy) were not sensitive enough to detect fluorinated compounds (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/7BPU6L8S\"></cite>). \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the lack of comparability between the simulated values and the available measurements, our simulation allows us to isolate the dust pollution potentially generated by a single steelworks in the past and to understand how far it reached over time. From this point, the analysis could be extended to other industrial plants and other types of pollution, which would probably bring us closer to the historical measurements. At the same time, the lack of detail in these measurements, which obviously cannot be measured again, creates an opportunity for the use of modelling and simulation.\n"

    "## Limitations and lacunae of the dust simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this research, we have presented different decisions taken during the process of simulation, validation and visualization of the data. These decisions simplify and reduce the complexity of the problem, but they have been made consciously and serve a specific purpose: to simulate industrial dust pollution from a single factory in a given period, based on historical data; above, we have presented the results of these decisions. This simulation can change perspectives on the past, e.g. with looking at the seasonal changes of wind directions and therefore changes in dust distribution (which is often omitted in historical literature). In future developments, we could modify the model variables (e.g. using data from other sources) or include new variables and use a different model (see ([section 8.4](#anchor-Section-8-4)),). In any case, we have proven that data simulation based on historical data offers the option not only to recreate past situations, but also to isolate effects that would not be possible to analyse even with real measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these advantages, our simulation also has a number of limitations and gaps, to which we have already alluded in previous sections. Such limitations become relevant if we seek to understand the total pollution levels the analysed area were exposed to. First, not all dust emitting sources in the Belval region were considered; obviously, the steel industry was only one contributor to atmospheric pollution among many – albeit a very important one (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/SQ4TQY24\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/FZS9EXTQ\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/EG7EKVXT\"></cite>). Pollution from households, industrial heating and traffic (motor vehicles and trains) accounted for some of the dust particles as well. Second, regarding the mathematical formula (1) used (presented in ([section 6](#anchor-Section-6)),), a few parameters must be analysed critically. The choice of a Gaussian model in itself involves simplifications. The model assumes that the contaminants come unidirectionally from one point source (one of several chimneys) at a constant emission rate Q, with the wind direction always aligned in one axis, considering the time frame of one month (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VJJH2QQ8\"></cite>, <cite data-cite=\"9139636/VFY3UZHT\"></cite>). This assumption does not cover intramonth variations and only considers one metallurgical plant (from a total of three in Esch alone). The model is not suitable for low wind speeds, and in terms of meteorological data only averages for Luxembourg City (the 10th and 20th of each month), which is about 20 km from Belval, were used. Since Gaussian plume models used in the calculation of atmospheric pollution usually consider the specific features of the surrounding (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VJJH2QQ8\"></cite>), our formula could be extended to involve terrain information and a greater radius could be covered to better observe long-range effects. State-of-the-art Gaussian models like AERMOD, CTDM and ADMS try to extend the basic equation by including additional factors like a complex terrain (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/VFY3UZHT\"></cite>).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor influencing the results is our use of US data from 1963 (<cite data-cite=\"9139636/QGZMVKKP\"></cite>) concerning average dust values for different steelmaking techniques and typical filter installation dates. Steelmaking and filter use vary between individual steel plants. The production data used covered only annual values; consequently, data on monthly production would make the simulation more precise. To better interpret the calculated dust values with regard to regulatory limit values and to determine a possible health effect, it would be useful to identify the dust fractions and pollutants contained therein. This is complicated, however, as historical dust samples have not been preserved and documents on measurements performed in the past (see 7.2) only study a small set of pollutants. Dust pollution values are usually standardised using temperature and pressure, which presents another limitation for interpretation. Lastly, the dust values identified using the model are technique specific (e.g. for Thomas steel) and do not relate to dust generation processes (e.g. sintering) used to set limit values for current EU regulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise, the dust simulation of the Belval complex between 1911 and 1997 is just a starting point towards modelling the operation of a real-world process: the total generation and spread of pollution to which the inhabitants of Esch and the surrounding area were exposed. In ([section 8.4](#anchor-Section-8-4)),, we offer a few possible ways of optimising the simulation in future research.\n"

    "### Optimisation and improvement of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the lacunae mentioned in ([section 8.3](#anchor-Section-8-3)), can be improved, thereby opening possibilities for further research. Other emission types like traffic, heating and other industrial plants could be considered, as well as the terrain around the point sources. The overlap of multiple dust generating sources and the resulting plumes, however, involves the risk of making the visualisation too complex and therefore confusing. As we state above, the model and used parameters were chosen on purpose, to simulate an isolated phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model area could be expanded, and temperature and pressure data could be considered. All these changes would increase the complexity of the mathematical formula. The meteorological data for the years 1911-1948 could be digitised to access additional data such as the wind directions and speeds for all months. Moreover, subdividing dust particles into different pollutants and fractions would enhance accuracy, while the generation of dust for each individual ironmaking and steelmaking process could be an interesting parameter to analyse further (especially with regard to the health impact of dust). However, the latter extension of the simulation is at the limit of what is practically feasible, since past dust samples (or contemporary analyses) from the respective processes are required for a precise investigation of the dust, its fractions and its origins. For several short periods, a composition analysis of the dust particles was performed; for other periods, the amount of dust created by different processes in the plant was measured, as explained in ([section 8.2](#anchor-Section-8-2)),. Using these data points is a possible way to extend the simulation, even if only for these specific years. Finally, it would be beneficial to look for average dust values produced by Luxembourg’s steel industry, monthly production data, filter installation dates and filter efficiency rates. Such data is most likely present in the corporate archives of ARBED, which are unfortunately not completely accessible for researchers. The optimisation possibilities outlined above would take our study beyond its initial scope.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Air pollution has a long history: it is not only a problem of the past but also an issue affecting the present and the future. Especially in industrialised regions, atmospheric pollution is not only annoying; it can also be a dangerous companion of daily life. Dust particles in the respirable fraction pose the most worrisome threats to human health, as they can lead to lung diseases. In many parts of the world, the steel industry has contributed significantly to the total mass of airborne dust. Improvements in production techniques and the installation of filters, as well as legislative measures and economic crises, have influenced air pollution over the years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis outlined the evaluation of dust production from a single plant in terms of plausibility and health effects. The simulated dust concentrations were compared to measurements and observations from the past, representing the ‘scientifically proven reality’ during a specific time period. For the simulation, a Gaussian plume model was used; the inserted parameters were analysed critically in terms of their limitations and possible improvements. Given the lack of availability of data regarding the dates of filter installations in Belval, secondary literature on the US case was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research applied a modelling method widely used in applied sciences, using data from historical sources as the parameters of the calculation. One of the challenges of modelling and simulation is to find the right balance between complexity (and therefore precision) and interpretability. In this case, given the already added complexity of the interdisciplinary approach, we decided to use a simplified model, which can be a precedent for creating new ways of generating historical data. At the same time, it allows us to present evidence (albeit on just a fraction of the dust to which inhabitants were exposed) and to understand the impact on health in a specific historical context. \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to visualise the pollution as coming from just one chimney has important benefits, since the addition of multiple dust sources might overload the visualisation (in the latter case, it would no longer be possible to discriminate between the origins of the dust). Furthermore, it has never been possible to measure the isolated dust concentration of a single plant using samplers, as there are always other dust sources. In sum, our model can serve as a basis for studying atmospheric pollution released from one selected source and offers the potential to be extended by looking at other contributing factors. The data visualisation produced as the result of this research was used in the context of a public history project, making complex historical and scientific data accessible to the public. \n"

     "abstract": "In the sector of occupational safety and health only a limited amount of studies are concerned with the conversion of inhalable to respirable dust. This conversion is of high importance for retrospective evaluations of exposure levels or of occupational diseases. For this reason a possibility to convert inhalable into respirable dust is discussed in this study. To determine conversion functions from inhalable to respirable dust fractions, 15 120 parallel measurements in the exposure database MEGA (maintained at the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance) are investigated by regression analysis. For this purpose, the whole data set is split into the influencing factors working activity and material. Inhalable dust is the most important predictor variable and shows an adjusted coefficient of determination of 0.585 (R2 adjusted to sample size). Further improvement of the model is gained, when the data set is split into six working activities and three material groups (e.g. high temperature processing, adj. R2 = 0.668). The combination of these two variables leads to a group of data concerned with high temperature processing with metal, which gives rise to a better description than the whole data set (adj. R2 = 0.706). Although it is not possible to refine these groups further systematically, seven improved groups are formed by trial and error, with adj. R2 between 0.733 and 0.835: soldering, casting (metalworking), welding, high temperature cutting, blasting, chiseling/embossing, and wire drawing. The conversion functions for the seven groups are appropriate candidates for data reconstruction and retrospective exposure assessment. However, this is restricted to a careful analysis of the working conditions. All conversion functions are power functions with exponents between 0.454 and 0.946. Thus, the present data do not support the assumption that respirable and inhalable dust are linearly correlated in general.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Steel manufacturing produces dust, fumes, and pollutant gases that may give adverse health effects to the respiratory function of workers. Improper occupational hygiene practice in the workplace will affect both workers wellbeing and productivity.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the level of particulate matter [(PM2.5, PM10, and Total Particulate Matter (TPM)], and trace metal dust concentrations in different sections of a steel plant and compare with the occupational exposure values.\nMETHODS: The work environmental parameters of the particulate matters were evaluated using Indoor Air Quality, while metal dust concentrations were measured using portable personal air sampler. A total of 184 personal samples were randomly collected from workers in three major sections; steel making plant, direct reduced plant, and support group. Trace metal dust concentrations were subjected to wet mineral acid mixture digestion and analysed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS).\nRESULTS: The overall average PM2.5 concentration observed was varied according to the section: steel making plant was 0.18 mg/m3, direct reduced iron plant was 0.05 mg/m3, and support plant was 0.05 mg/m3. Average PM 10 concentration in steel making shop (SMS) plant, direct reduced (DR) plant, and support plant were 0.70 mg/m3, 0.84 mg/m3, and 0.58 mg/m3, respectively. The average TWA8 of trace metal dusts (cobalt and chromium) in all the sections exceeded 1 to 3 times the ACGIH prescribed values, OSHA PELs, NIOSH RELs as well as USECHH OSHA, whereas TWA8 concentration of nickel for each section did not exceed the occupational exposure values.\nCONCLUSIONS: The average PM2.5, PM10 and TPM did not exceed the prescribed values, while average trace metal dust concentration TWA8 for cobalt and chromium in all plants exceeded occupational exposure prescribed values. However, the nickel found did not exceed the prescribed values in all the plants except for NIOSH RELs.",

     "abstract": ", The identification of the dust characteristics\nin coal mine working\nfaces is essential for preventing coal dust explosion and occupational\ndiseases. In this paper, dust samples from the coal mines in southern\nShanxi province and Henan province, central North China, were selected\nas the research objects. The results show that the dust contains primarily\norganic matter, as well as considerable amounts of minerals. The chemical\ncomposition of dust at the working faces is the most complex. According\nto the proportion of PM10, the dust composition can be\ndivided into three types: symmetrical, fine-dominated, and coarse-dominated.\nThe wettability of dust increases with the increase of the oxygen–carbon\nratio on its surface, increase of ash content, decrease of fixed carbon\ncontent, and decrease of particle size. In addition, the great variety\nof harmful elements in dust, some with a high content, can harm the\nhuman body. An explosion index is proposed to evaluate the likeliness\ntendency of coal dust explosion based on several key affecting factors.\nThe surfactant (0.05% AN solution) adopted in this paper can significantly\nincrease the wettability of coal dust and inhibit the generation of\ndust greatly, showing good ability in preventing coal dust explosion\nand occupational diseases.",

     "abstract": "Background: This report is based on an independent study carried out by medical professionals of the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori (National Cancer Institute) in Milan, Italy, and aimed to assess the incidence of respiratory diseases in a Brazilian community (Piquiá de Baixo, in the city of Açailandia) exposed to extreme air pollution in connection to a local steel manufacturing plant. The study has the objective to contribute to the existing literature on the health risks associated with fine particle pollution (PM2.5) due to steel production with data from Brazil.\nMethods: The study is based on a cross-sectional sample of the resident population of Piquiá de Baixo age 16 or over consisting of 220 people. We collected data about the health conditions of participant subjects in two ways: a) medical history questionnaires and b) clinical assessment of respiratory function through spirometry testing. The results were evaluated based on comparative studies.\nResults: According to the spirometric tests performed, 28 % of the sample population suffers from respiratory pathologies (for the most part of restrictive rather than obstructive nature). This incidence rate is between six and two times higher than those reported in similar studies carried out in other countries (which range between 4.6 and 14.5 %). In addition, the incidence rate is also significantly high in light of the fact that our sample population did not include the category of subjects most at risk for pulmonary disorders in connection to air pollution caused by the Piquiá steel processing complex: in other words, men and women employed in the steel mills or in connection with their industrial cycle (as many as 434 Piquiá residents age 16 and over were unable to participate to our study due to “work-related reasons”).\nConclusions: In light of the above considerations, we believe that our findings contribute to the existing literature on the correlation between pulmonary disease and air pollution in industrialized areas, while warranting further scientific research on the public health consequences of industrial production in Piquiá de Baixo. In turn, on the ethical plane, we believe that research of this nature strengthens the need to advocate for more severe environmental and health policies aimed at limiting the hazards associated with the steel industry in Piquiá and in similar contexts around the world.",

     "abstract": "Boundaries between industrial and urban areas in developing countries are not clearly deﬁned, but pollution effect assessment of industrial activities on potentially toxic metal (PTM) distribution in these areas has rarely been investigated. Fifteen villages and eight communities surrounding the industrial areas from Anyang, China, were chosen as research objects in this study. A total of 78 windowsill dust and 78 surface soil samples were collected to determine the pollution levels, spatial distribution and risk indices of nine PTMs. PTM concentrations (expect Cr, Mn and Ni in surface soil) in the surveyed region were higher than the local soil background values. Amongst these PTMs, serious Cd and As pollution was discovered, and Cd and As in windowsill dust and surface soil exceeded the background value by 73.00 and 9.59, 9.74 and 10.92 times, respectively. Compared with the Igeo in surface soil, a large degree of variation in Igeo for the different PTMs was found in windowsill dust. The interpolated spatial distribution of dust Cr, Zn, Pb, Cd and soil Mn, Ni and Cu had a gradually decreasing pollution trend from the south to the north due to the prevailing wind directions in winter in the study area. Results of multivariate statistics reﬂected that industrial production and trafﬁc emission affected the concentration of PTMs in windowsill dust and surface soil. The non-carcinogenic risks for children (soil: 12.4; dust: 19.2) were larger than those for adults (soil: 1.02; dust: 1.51). This ﬁnding suggested that industrial activities caused serious harm to the residents around industrial areas.",

     "abstract": "This review summarizes occurrence of organic and inorganic contaminants in house dust and the contribution of house dust as a marker of indoor exposure. Several studies have identified house dust as an important route of toxicant exposure. Often levels of pollutants found in house dust, including compounds banned long ago, are significant sources of exposure for the general population, especially children. House dust is a sink and repository for semivolatile organic compounds and particle-bound matter. Analyses of compounds in house dust are a measure of indoor contamination but may also provide valuable information for assessment of human indoor exposure. The objective of analyzing house dust are to describe the extent, distribution, and determinants of exposure, to identify possible sources of indoor contamination, or to record elevated indoor exposure leading to intervention or sanitation. House dust and compounds adsorbed to house dust may enter the human body by inhalation of suspended and resuspended particles, through nondietary ingestion of dust, through ingestion of particles adhering to food, surfaces in the homes, and on the skin as well as by absorption through the skin. The quantity of dust inhaled and deposited in the differing parts of the alveolar tract is dependent on the aerodynamic diameter. Exposure to house dust does not exclusively and may not even predominantly occur via inhalation, however. For instance, ingestion of house dust particles adhering to food, objects, and the skin or direct absorption through the skin may be primary routes of exposure (Lewis et al. 1994). Samples referred to as \"house dust\" vary significantly because house dust may be of different origin, amount, and composition and the method of sampling the dust influences the properties of the sample used for analysis. Passive and active sampling methods are described and discussed. For the analysis of organic pollutants in house dust, the < or = 63-microns fraction should be favored because variances caused by inhomogeneity of the subsample are low. Results from studies on house dust are presented for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), plasticizers (phthalates, phenols), flame retardants, other organic xenobiotics, and inorganic constituents. If available, medians as a measure of the average concentration and the 90th or 95th percentiles are added as reference values. The review of the literature points out that ingestion of house dust may be a major route of exposure to pesticides for infants and toddlers. So far, only a few guideline values or limiting values for house dust exist. For lead in house dust, the health risk is regulated only in the U.S. and for PAH in the Federal Republic of Germany. Risk associated with the ingestion of contaminated dust by small children (age, 1-6 years; mean body weight, 16 kg) can be estimated using the chronic oral reference dose (RfD) and a daily intake of 100 mg house dust. The tentative benchmark house dust concentrations that are believed to be without health effect for small children were calculated for several compounds from their current RfD. Comparison with the maximum concentrations reviewed for chlorpyrifos, DDT, and diazinon indicates that the tolerable exposure concentration in house dust might be exceeded and that chlorpyrifos especially can be considered as a potential hazard to householders. The role of house dust as an exposure source is gaining more attention over the years but several open questions related to health remain to be resolved. Pesticides applied outside or within the household that are absorbed and preserved by house dust can lead through the everyday activities of children and infants to increased exposure. Residential exposure including house dust residues contribute to combined exposure from dietary and nondietary sources. It is justified to shift more attention to indoor pollution by house dust contamination and to improve the risk assessment of nondietary ingestion, but any health-based standard must be accompanied by a specific dust sampling method.",

     "abstract": "Dusts can be defined as fine coal particles of size range 1–400μm. Dust control has the dual purpose of cleaning the air and recovery of coal. It also helps protect people’s health. The sources of dust generation have been identified. Dust prevention and dust collection are the two basic approaches to dust control. The common dust prevention solutions comprise of sprays, surfactants and foams, designed transfer chutes, and engineered transfer chutes. The right approach depends upon the specific conditions. There are various types of dust collectors applicable to particle size and air velocity. The selection and design criteria of dust collectors have been elaborated. The efficiency of dust collectors and the effects of controlling factors are explained. Four types of collectors have been broadly described – gravitational settling chambers, cyclones, fabric filters, and electrostatic precipitators. Their merits and demerits are highlighted.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the concentrations and health risk of heavy metals in urban soils from a steel industrial district in China. A total of 115 topsoil samples from Anshan city, Liaoning, Northeast China were collected and analyzed for Cr, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, and Ni. The geoaccumulation index (Igeo), pollution index (PI), and potential ecological risk index (PER) were calculated to assess the pollution level in soils. The hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risk (RI) were used to assess human health risk of heavy metals. The average concentration of Cr, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, and Ni were 69.9, 0.86, 45.1, 213, 52.3, and 33.5 mg/kg, respectively. The Igeo and PI values of heavy metals were in the descending order of Cd 4Zn4 Cu4 Pb 4Ni 4Cr. Higher Igeo value for Cd in soil indicated that Cd pollution was moderate. Pollution index indicated that urban soils were moderate to highly polluted by Cd, Zn, Cu, and Pb. The spatial distribution maps of heavy metals revealed that steel industrial district was the contamination hotspots. Principal component analysis (PCA) and matrix cluster analysis classiﬁed heavy metals into two groups, indicating common industrial sources for Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd. Matrix cluster analysis classiﬁed the sampling sites into four groups. Sampling sites within steel industrial district showed much higher concentrations of heavy metals compared to the rest of sampling sites, indicating signiﬁcant contamination introduced by steel industry on soils. The health risk assessment indicated that non-carcinogenic values were below the threshold values. The hazard index (HI) for children and adult has a descending order of Cr4Pb 4Cd 4 Cu4 Ni 4Zn. Carcinogenic risks due to Cr, Cd, and Ni in urban soils were within acceptable range for adult. Carcinogenic risk value of Cr for children is slightly higher than the threshold value, indicating that children are facing slight threat of Cr. These results provide basic information of heavy metal pollution control and environment management in steel industrial regions. & 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

     "abstract": "Source-contribution assessment of ambient NO2 concentration was performed at Pantnagar, India through simulation of two urban mathematical dispersive models namely Gaussian Finite Line Source Model (GFLSM) and Industrial Source Complex Model (ISCST-3) and model performances were evaluated. Principal approaches were development of comprehensive emission inventory, monitoring of traffic density and regional air quality and conclusively simulation of urban dispersive models. Initially, 18 industries were found responsible for emission of 39.11 kg/h of NO2 through 43 elevated stacks. Further, vehicular emission potential in terms of NO2 was computed as 7.1 kg/h. Air quality monitoring delineates an annual average NO2 concentration of 32.6 μg/m3. Finally, GFLSM and ISCST-3 were simulated in conjunction with developed emission inventories and existing meteorological conditions. Models simulation indicated that contribution of NO2 from industrial and vehicular source was in a range of 45–70% and 9–39%, respectively. Further, statistical analysis revealed satisfactory model performance with an aggregate accuracy of 61.9%.",

     "abstract": "At present there are two main approaches to modelling gas dispersion within the process safety risk assessment arena. Historically the Gaussian approach has dominated, however, with the improvement of computing power available in relatively low-cost platforms, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has begun to challenge that dominance. Both approaches rely on a mathematical description of transport with advectiondiffusion equations. However, there are a number of simplifications that are needed for analytical Gaussian solutions to be derived which are not needed for CFD solutions. The Gaussian approach often applies simplified flows over flat terrain, whereas CFD accounts for flow velocities and turbulence and their effects on mixing and can be applied in more complex three-dimensional environments. The questions this paper asks are: Is CFD modelling more mathematically correct than the Gaussian approach? And, Does the emergence of CFD into the mainstream pose an opportunity or threat? To answer these questions this paper will explore the previously mentioned differences between approaches.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents ongoing work on investigating text mining by scientific workflows and hypotheses testing by computer simulation as new digital methods in the digital humanities and particularly in the literary studies. In the course of the eXplore! project, the methods are developed for analyzing autobiographic texts and particularly for investigating the diaries of Klaus Mann, a famous German writer, with regards to the influences on the writer’s literary productivity. Text mining is used to build up a data basis for an agent-based model that can be used in simulation studies to answer what-if-questions about a writer’s creative writing processes. A further focus is put on the reusability of these methods to facilitate an application beyond the project’s pilot study. For this purpose, we model and apply scientific workflows, populate a repository of proven workflows, and investigate an approach to reuse assistance by case-based reasoning.",

     "abstract": "This study examines the concentrations of air pollution in the vicinity of a combined heat and power plant (CHP) and a communication route, using computer modeling of pollutant dispersion and spatial analysis based on real measurements in the city of Łódź, Poland, Europe. The research takes into account the concentrations of particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PM1.0) and gaseous pollutants (SO2 and VOC) in winter and summer. The spatial distribution of pollutants is discussed, including the presence of areas with increased accumulations of pollutants. Because atmospheric air has no natural boundaries, when analyzing any location, not only local sources of pollution, but also background pollution, should be analyzed. A clear difference was observed between the concentrations of pollutants in the summer and winter seasons, with significantly higher concentrations in the winter (heating) period. The impacts of road transport, individual heating systems, and combined heat and power plants were also assessed. Computer calculations confirmed that road transport accounted for the largest share of both PM and SO2 emissions. The CHP plant was responsible for the smallest percentage of dust emissions and was the next largest producer of SO2 emissions. The share of the total emissions from the individual sources were compared with the results of detailed field tests. The numerical analysis of selected pollution sources in combination with the field analysis shows that the identified pollution sources included in the analysis represent only a part of the total observed pollutant concentrations (suggesting that other background sources account for the rest).",

     "abstract": "This article presents a GIS-based multi-source and multi-box modeling approach (GMSMB) to predict the spatial concentration distributions of airborne pollutant on local and regional scales. In this method, an extended multi-box model combined with a multi-source and multi-grid Gaussian model are developed within the GIS framework to examine the contributions from both point- and area-source emissions. By using GIS, a large amount of data including emission sources, air quality monitoring, meteorological data, and spatial location information required for air quality modeling are brought into an integrated modeling environment. It helps more details of spatial variation in source distribution and meteorological condition to be quantitatively analyzed. The developed modeling approach has been examined to predict the spatial concentration distribution of four air pollutants (CO, NO2, SO2 and PM2.5) for the State of California. The modeling results are compared with the monitoring data. Good agreement is acquired which demonstrated that the developed modeling approach could deliver an effective air pollution assessment on both regional and local scales to support air pollution control and management planning.",

     "abstract": "Modeling of dispersion of air pollutants in the atmosphere is one of the most important and challenging scientific problems. There are several natural and anthropogenic events where passive or chemically active compounds are emitted into the atmosphere. The effect of these chemical species can have serious impacts on our environment and human health. Modeling the dispersion of air pollutants can predict this effect. Therefore, development of various model strategies is a key element for the governmental and scientific communities. We provide here a brief review on the mathematical modeling of the dispersion of air pollutants in the atmosphere. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of several model tools and strategies, namely Gaussian, Lagrangian, Eulerian and CFD models. We especially focus on several recent advances in this multidisciplinary research field, like parallel computing using graphical processing units, or adaptive mesh refinement.",

The results are then applied to solving an inverse problem in which emission source rates are determined from a given set of groundlevel contaminant measurements. This source identiﬁcation problem can be formulated as an overdetermined linear system of equations that is most easily solved using the method of least squares. Various generalizations of this problem are discussed, and we illustrate our results with an application to the study of zinc emissions from a smelting operation.",
